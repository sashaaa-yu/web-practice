        <p class="p1">Mayday evolved from So Band which was formed by Ashin, Monster and the first drummer Chien You-ta in 1995 while they were studying in The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University .</p>
        <p class="p2"> They were later joined by Masa and Stone, who were attending the same school. After graduation, the members went to different universities but continued to perform in pubs and eateries. </p>
        <p class="p3">They were also actively involved in promoting the growing rock music trend in Taiwan.</p>
        <p class="p3 plus">In 1997, the band registered to perform at the Formoz Festival under the moniker Mayday. Mayday was greatly influenced by The Beatles, believing
            that rock had the power to change the world, and spread ideals of love and peace through their songs.</p>
